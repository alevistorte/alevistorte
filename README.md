 I have a degree in Telecommunications and Electronics Engineering from the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica de La Habana, CUJAE. I love technology and software development and I enjoy challenging tasks, learning new skills to improve my experience and collaborating with smart engineers to learn from them. Currently, I'm a SysAdmin and my daily work consists of automating processes and creating tools to be more productive using Bash, Python.
 
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django and Javascript to turn my professional career to software development.
