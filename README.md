### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I have a degree in Telecommunications and Electronics Engineering from the Universidad TecnolÃ³gica de La Habana, CUJAE. I love technology and software development and I enjoy challenging tasks, learning new skills to improve my experience and collaborating with smart engineers to learn from them. I worked a SysAdmin and my duties consisted of automating processes and creating tools to be more productive using Bash, Python.
 
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django and React to turn my professional career to software development. 
 - ðŸ¤” I would appreciate if you could open an Issue suggesting improvements or things I can add to make my projects more interesting and learn new things along the way.
